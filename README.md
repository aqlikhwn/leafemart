## � 1.1 Introduction

The Leafé Mart Mahallah Bilal Web Application is an e-commerce platform developed for the residents of Mahallah and students of IIUM. The application aims to transform the current purchasing activities into a convenient, modern, and user-friendly digital shopping experience.

Currently, most shopping within Mahallah Bilal relies on physical visits to the mart, a process that can be time-consuming, particularly during peak hours, exam seasons, or when students have tight schedules. This web application addresses this challenge by providing a solution for online purchasing.

This project delivers a fully functional web application enabling users to browse products, check availability, view prices, and make seamless purchases online. The platform features a modern, clean visual design and a responsive layout to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and consistent experience on both mobile and desktop screens.

## 🔴 1.2 Problem Description

### 1.2.1 Background of the Problem

The students experience challenges like a tight class timetable, uncertain stock, and a long queue of people lining up especially when it comes to peak hours. There is no online platform for users to search for items available for purchase in advance and store information.

Because of the growing dependency on online services in IIUM campuses, as well as for the convenience of Mahallah residents, a web application will provide a way for Leafé Mart to upgrade and simplify their operation. This application would benefit users with an organized, accessible, and user-friendly means of dealing with the store without requiring their presence.

### 1.2.2 Problem Statement

1. **No Online Product Visibility** — Users cannot check for the product availability, view prices, or categories without physically visiting the store.

2. **Limited Operating Hours Information** — Students cannot know if the store is open or closed without checking physically.

3. **No Order or Reservation System** — Students cannot order or reserve items, which could lead to disappointment when the items run out of stock.

4. **Inefficient Inventory Updates** — Staff operators manually track the stock, which may cause some errors and delays.

5. **Long Queues and Congestion** — During peak hours, the store gets crowded, causing slow checkout and inconvenience.

## 🎯 1.3 Project Objectives

The project objectives are as follows:

1. **To make shopping process digitalized**
   - By giving students an easy-to-use online platform to browse products, check prices, and see stock availability.

2. **To assist Leafé Mart staff in managing operations**
   - Provide an admin dashboard for managing products, categories, stock, orders, and announcements in a systematic manner.

3. **To enhance user experience**
   - Develop a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

4. **To reduce long queues and overcrowding**
   - By offering an online alternative that allows students to check items and place simulated orders without physically visiting the mart during peak hours.

5. **To approve communication with customers**
   - By providing clear and timely updates, operational hours, and announcements directly through web applications.

## ⚠️ 1.5 Constraints

The development of the Leafé Mart web application is subject to several limitations that may affect the design, functionality, and timeline of the project. These constraints include:

### Technical Constraints
- No real-time connection to the physical store's actual inventory; stock updates depend on manual input from staff.
- Payment gateway integration may not be implemented due to time and budget restrictions; transactions may be simulated.
- The system relies on the team's understanding of Laravel, which may require additional learning time.
- Deployment is limited to available resources, such as localhost if hosting is unavailable.

### Network Requirements
1. Stable internet connection
2. Browser access (Chrome, Firefox)

### Additional Infrastructure Limitations
If the Kulliyyah does not provide a hosting server, the project will be demonstrated on a localhost to ensure smooth execution. Alternatively, free hosting options or temporary educational hosting platforms may be considered to allow online deployment for presentation purposes. This approach ensures that the development continues without interruption, despite any institutional limitations.
